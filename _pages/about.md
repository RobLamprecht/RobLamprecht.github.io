Rob Lamprecht graduated Cum Laude from Wofford College in Spartanburg, SC with a B.S. in computer science and a concentration in neuroscience. Rob currently works as a research technician II for the Fong Lab located in the department of biomedical engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University; a position he has held for almost two years. Working primarily with cortical electrophysiology and visual psychophysics, his time here has resulted in a abstract publication on which he is the first author and presented at the 2023 Society for Neuroscience conference. Rob's current project is focusing on eliciting visual plasticity via inactivation of on-type retinal ganglion cells.

He has previously  worked as a research assistant in the Dale Lab located at the Dale Lab located in the Department of physiology and functional genomics at the University of Florida studying spinal cord plasticity following cervical spinal cord injuries.
